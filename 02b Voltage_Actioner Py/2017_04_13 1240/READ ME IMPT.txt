rc: Windows update on April 12, 2017, broke the powershell command "Stop-Computer", it now needs elavated priviledges.
However, as the OSVR windows is not updated on April 12, and is unlikely to be updated as it is only connected via VPN to a fixed customer site, the code on "2017_04_12 1245" should still work.

HOWEVER, for OSVRs that are updated to latest windows release after April 12, we are likely to need to use new code that avoids powershell "STop-Computer" command.
